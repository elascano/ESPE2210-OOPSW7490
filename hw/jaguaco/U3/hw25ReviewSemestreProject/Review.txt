Program: Registration of subjects and students (Delete, verify and assign NRC)
This piece of code is from a conditional switch, it was used with a for loop to assign the code of a subject and we obtained the name of that subject by means of another for loop, entering the grades of a student X within the specified range and thus doing the same as long as dim3 is different from 3 (dim3 was found as a constant in line 3 of the program) and their respective credits. In addition, it was possible to enter the grades of up to 3 subjects, calculating the final grade of each subject of the student to "save time" but looking and analyzing the function contains many errors
Function analysis time 5:33 minutes
