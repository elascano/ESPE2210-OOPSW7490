Decorator: The Decorator pattern is a programming technique that allows you to add new functionality to an object at runtime without altering its original structure. In the context of a gun game, we can use this pattern to improve the performance of a base weapon, in this case an assault rifle, by adding new features or functionality to it through decorations.To implement this pattern, we first create the Weapon base class that represents the assault rifle with its basic functionality. Then we create several decorator classes that add new functionality to the weapon.
